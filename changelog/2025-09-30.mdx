## What's new

### Selective timeline rendering on the editor
Export only what is needed—avoid rendering the entire video. This lets you export multiple outputs from the same timeline.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a draft or open an existing one">
    Start a new **Draft** from the **Library** and add your video to the timeline, or open an existing one.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mark In/Out points">
    Use <kbd>I</kbd> and <kbd>O</kbd> to set start and end for the segment you want to export.
    <Frame caption="Segment marked in the timeline">
        ![Selective rendering in editor](/images/changelog/30-09-2025/selective-timeline-rendering.jpg)
    </Frame>
    <Info>
      You can clear your selection anytime by pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd>.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Render the selection">
    Click **Render** button on the action bar to export only the marked segment.
    <Frame caption="Render button on the action bar with the selected time">

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Editable subtitles
Subtitles are now **fully editable in the editor**—no external tools or re‑uploads. Fix transcription errors, refine phrasing, or localise content directly. Updates save instantly and are embedded on render.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a clip on the timeline">
    Select a clip on the timeline and open the **Properties** panel, go to the **Subtitles** tab. Generate auto-subtitles if not already enabled.
    <Frame caption="Subtitles tab in the Properties panel">

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scroll down to edit captions">
    Scroll down to see time-stamped captions that you can click on to edit.
    <Frame caption="Time-stamped captions in the Properties panel">

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Render with updates">
    Save your changes to apply updated subtitles to your draft. This will reflect in any renders as well. 
  </Step>
</Steps>

- Metadata export improvements — Template exports now include **prompt columns** in CSV files for clearer downstream data entry and automation.

- Tree node messaging — Clearer messaging when **rename** or **cut** actions are disabled on Connected Folders.

- Face‑tracked video rendering — Fixed rendering glitches for face‑tracked content in the editor.
