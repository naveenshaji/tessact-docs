### üéôÔ∏è Audio Analysis

You can now **analyse audio files** directly in the platform. The system will transcribe the audio and display it with **timestamps**, making it easier to track, review, and use content. Best results come with clear speech recordings.

### üåç Global Queue for Rendering

We‚Äôve added a **Global Queue** so you can view all your rendering processes in one place. No matter where you are in the platform, you‚Äôll be able to see progress and manage ongoing renders without switching back and forth.

### üé¨ Editor Templates

The editor now supports **custom templates**. Define your assets - images, video, audio, artwork on the timeline and save them as reusable templates. A common use case is setting up an intro or outro once and applying it to any remix or video without rebuilding it from scratch.

### ‚ö° Workflows ‚Äì Better Step Creation

We heard your feedback on workflows being a bit confusing. With this first update, we‚Äôve **redesigned the workflow step creation flow**. Users are now presented with steps in a much **clearer and more structured way**, making it easier to understand what each step does and how to use it effectively.
