Connect Tessact to **Zapier** so your Library activity can launch automations across more than 6,000 apps. The 13 October 2025 release introduced outbound webhooks, letting you push structured payloads into Zapier every time Tessact detects a key event in your workspace.

<Info>
Zapier uses Tessact's **Trigger webhook** action. Once you save an action in **Settings → Actions**, any matching event sends a POST request to the Zap webhook URL you supply.
</Info>

## Why connect Tessact to Zapier?

- **Close the loop on asset reviews** — Notify the right reviewers in Slack or Teams as soon as status changes land in Tessact.  
- **Sync metadata everywhere** — Update spreadsheets, Airtable bases, or project trackers with the latest asset details without manual exports.  
- **Kick off downstream automation** — Launch editing jobs, send invoices, or open support tickets the moment AI analysis completes.  
- **Stay real-time** — Events post to Zapier immediately, keeping your operational systems in sync with Tessact.

---

## Prerequisites

- Tessact workspace access with permission to manage **Settings → Actions**  
- Zapier account with access to **Webhooks by Zapier** (available on all paid plans)  
- A target Zap that will receive Tessact events

<Tip>
Decide which Tessact folders and asset events should trigger automation ahead of time. This keeps your Zaps purposeful and avoids noise.

## Create the Tessact webhook action

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate a Zapier webhook URL">
    In Zapier, create a new Zap and choose **Webhooks by Zapier → Catch Hook** as the trigger. Copy the unique webhook URL that Zapier provides.
    <Frame caption="Zapier Catch Hook trigger configuration">
      ![Zapier webhook trigger](/images/changelog/2025-10-13/zapier-setup.jpg)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Settings → Actions in Tessact">
    Navigate to **Settings → Actions** and select **Create New Action** to add an automation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose an event trigger">
    Pick the Tessact event you want to monitor—for example **File status change** or **File uploaded to folder**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Trigger webhook and enter details">
    Set **Action type** to **Trigger webhook**, give the action a name, paste the Zapier webhook URL, choose an optional watch folder scope, and define the JSON payload you want Tessact to send. Save the action to activate it.

    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Only assets or folders affected *after* the webhook action is created will emit events. Historical actions are not replayed.
</Warning>

## Supported Tessact triggers

The 13 October release ships with the following event triggers. Configure separate actions if you want distinct payloads or Zap behavior per trigger.

- Comment added to file (includes comment text, user email, video URL)  
- File status change  
- File uploaded to folder  
- File viewed  
- File downloaded  
- File analyzing started  
- File analyzing complete

<Info>
Additional triggers and complementary actions are on the roadmap. Keep an eye on future release notes for updates.
</Info>

## Designing the payload

Your payload template can contain static values, Tessact variables, or structured JSON. Zapier automatically parses JSON bodies, so you can use nested structures for richer context.

```json payload-template.json
{
  "event": "{{trigger.name}}",
  "assetId": "{{asset.id}}",
  "assetName": "{{asset.name}}",
  "folder": "{{folder.path}}",
  "performedBy": "{{user.email}}",
  "timestamp": "{{event.timestamp}}",
  "metadataUrl": "{{asset.urls.metadata}}",
  "notes": "Sent from Tessact"
}
```

<Tip>
Use Tessact's **Test webhook** button after saving the action. Zapier will capture the sample request so you can map each field to downstream steps.
</Tip>

---

## Build the Zapier workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test the trigger">
    In Zapier, click **Test Trigger** on your Catch Hook step. Perform the corresponding action in Tessact (for example upload a file). Zapier should instantly show the payload.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map fields to actions">
    Add the downstream app step (e.g., Slack, Gmail, Airtable) and map each field from the Tessact payload to the inputs you want to automate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add filters or paths (optional)">
    Insert Zapier **Filters** or **Paths** to branch on status values, specific folders, or user emails before running the action.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish the Zap">
    Turn the Zap on. Tessact will now POST to Zapier whenever the trigger condition is met.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example use cases

- **Editorial QA** — When an editor comments on a video, create a corresponding task in Asana with the clip URL attached.  
- **Delivery tracking** — After AI analysis completes, send a summary email with download links to the distribution team.  
- **Rights management** — On file downloads, log the activity in Airtable and notify legal for high-value titles.  
- **Localization workflow** — Fire a webhook when status changes to "Ready for Dubbing", triggering a Zap that creates jobs in a translation platform.

---

## Troubleshooting tips

- **No payload in Zapier:** Ensure the action is enabled and the Tessact event actually happened after it was saved. Use the test button to emit sample data.  
- **Unexpected payload fields:** Review your JSON template—invalid syntax causes Tessact to send a plain string instead of JSON. Validate with an online linter first.  
- **Multiple notifications:** Use Zapier filters or split actions per folder if the trigger is too broad.  
- **Permission errors:** Confirm your Tessact role can access the chosen watch folder and perform the action you are testing.

<Success>
Once the Zap is live, Tessact and Zapier stay in sync automatically—no additional maintenance required unless you change the webhook URL or payload schema.
</Success>
