## Overview

The **Library** is Tessact’s central repository for every asset in your workspace—raw footage, finished masters, thumbnails, audio stems, and more. Built for enterprise scale, the Library supports **millions of files** with virtualised scrolling and instant search responses.

## Selecting a View

Tessact offers two main presentation modes:

| View | Best for | Key controls |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **Grid** | Visual browsing, marketing teams, thumbnails | Card orientation, thumbnail fit/fill, flatten folders |
| **Table** | Metadata-driven work, archivists, compliance | Column selection, pinning, custom metadata views |

Use the **View Selector** in the upper-right corner of the Library to toggle between views. Your last-used view and layout persist per browser session.

### Grid View Options

<Frame caption="Grid view settings panel (aspect ratio, fit/fill, flatten)">
![Grid view settings](/images/grid-view-options.jpg)
</Frame>

- **Vertical vs. Horizontal cards** — Optimise for portrait or landscape material.  
- **Fit vs. Fill thumbnail** — Choose letterboxed accuracy or edge-to-edge crop.  
- **Flatten folders** — Display every asset in the hierarchy as a single scrollable wall.

<Tip>
Flatten folders when you need to preview all shots from a shoot day without drilling into sub-folders.
</Tip>

### Table View Customisation

<Frame caption="Customisable table with pinned columns and metadata fields">
![Table customisation](/images/table-view-options.jpg)
</Frame>

1. Select **View** → Properties to add any metadata field.   
2. Pin a column via its **⋯ context menu** (right-click or tap **⋯**) to keep it visible while scrolling wide datasets.
3. Move columns to the left or right to reorder them through the column context menu.  
4. **Sort** and **filter** icons appear on every view on the action bar at the top of the screen.
5. Assets can be grouped and sub-grouped by any metadata field by selecting **View** → Group by or **View** → Sub-group by.

<Info>
The Table view displays all available metadata fields by default, but you can customise the view to only show the fields you need.
</Info>

## Sorting, Filtering, and Search

An action bar spans the top of the Library with a few core controls:

| Control | Behaviour |
|---------|-----------|
| **Search** | Natural-language or boolean queries across filenames and metadata that are visible in the current view. |
| **Filter** | Apply multiple filters simultaneously. Filter by any technical or custom metadata field; conditions are additive by default. |
| **Sort** | Add one or more sort criteria. The order inside the Sort bar defines precedence (primary, secondary, tertiary, etc.). |
| **Upload** | Upload new assets to the Library from your current device. For recommended file formats, see [Media Formats](/media-formats). |
| **New Folder** | Create a new folder in the current path. |

Filters and sorts apply to both Grid and Table views, persisting when you switch layouts.

---

## Folder Navigation

- Once you navigate into any folder in the library, the sidebar changes to show a tree view with the current folder selected.
- Toggle **Flatten folders** to surface every asset in descendant directories without changing sidebar context.

## Bulk Actions & Context Menus

</Frame>

### Multi-select operations

1. Select multiple assets via checkboxes or drag selection.  
2. The select bar appears at the bottom of the screen with a few options:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Cut / Copy / Paste** | Move or duplicate assets within the Library. |
| **Delete** | Send to workspace recycle bin (retained 30 days). |
| **Rename** | Inline rename with slug safety checks. |
| **Remix** | Generate social media ready edits from the selected assets with AI. |

<Tip>
Use **Paste into folder** to preserve original hierarchy during moves.
</Tip>

## Performance at Scale

- **Virtual scrolling** renders only visible rows/cards for smooth performance on huge libraries.  
- **Parallel prefetch** loads thumbnails and metadata in background threads.  
- **Adaptive thumbnail quality**: grid-view avatars downgrade to proxies after 10 000 visible items to maintain a responsive UI.
