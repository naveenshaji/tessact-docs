---

Tessact pairs a robust media asset management (MAM) foundation with AI copilots that enrich, govern, and distribute content at scale. Use this page as a quick inventory of what ships with the platform today.

## Authentication

- **Single sign-on**: Delegate login to your identity provider so teams can use Tessact with existing credentials.
- **Two-factor authentication**: Add a second factor for privileged accounts to reduce the risk of credential compromise.

## Content Management

- **Multi-format ingest**: Support video, audio, images, documents, graphics, and canvas assets from a single workspace.
- **Metadata workspace**: Configure and curate the metadata fields your organisation cares about through a dedicated interface.
- **Reusable templates**: Create once, then apply metadata templates across any collection of assets.
- **Curated browsing**: Offer tailored playback and browsing experiences for each distribution use case or platform.
- **Technical metadata**: Capture and surface rich file-level metadata automatically for compliance and QC teams.
- **Version control**: Track and compare multiple cuts or deliverables against the same source asset.
- **Dynamic watermarking**: Overlay custom watermarks on every asset with user- or team-based rules.
- **Multi-view library**: Toggle between five distinct library layouts to match your workflow (grid, table, storyboard, etc.).
- **Metadata export**: Export library metadata in CSV, Excel, or PDF whenever you need an offline snapshot.

## AI Enrichment

- **Content-aware indexing**: Use AI to extract every meaningful detail from each asset, with logic tuned to the content type (episode, clip, promo, and more).
- **Metadata autofill**: Auto-populate casts, storylines, highlights, and other descriptive fields in 35+ languages - no more vendor handoffs.
- **AI-powered templates**: Build templates that include AI-driven fields and deliver consistent, on-brand metadata every time.
- **Promptable enrichment**: Provide custom prompts so Tessact's AI generates exactly the descriptors and tags your teams expect.
- **Auto subtitling**: Generate subtitles and captions in more than 35 languages directly from the source asset.
- **Thumbnail generation**: Let AI pick or create the best-fit thumbnail for each distribution surface.
- **Natural-language filters**: Describe what you need in plain language and let AI assemble the right filters and facets for fast discovery.

## Review & Collaboration

- **Inline comments**: Leave threaded comments and replies on any asset from desktop or mobile.
- **Creative mark-up**: Draw or annotate directly on top of the video player to give precise creative feedback.
- **Real-time notifications**: Stay on top of edits, comments, and assignments with instant alerts.
- **Guest sharing**: Share assets securely outside your organisation - no Tessact licence required - and collect feedback in one place.

## Auto Compliance

- **Visual detection**: Automatically flag compliance-sensitive visual elements before distribution.
- **Audio detection**: Detect restricted or brand-unsafe audio in 15+ languages, including Indian language support out of the box.
- **Custom AI models**: Train Tessact's AI on your policies and parameters to fine-tune compliance detection for your brand.
