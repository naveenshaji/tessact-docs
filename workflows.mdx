## Overview

Workflows are the backbone of collaboration in Tessact. A **workflow** defines *how work moves* from step to step across teams, which **AI agents** run (generative and analytical), and where **manual review layers** apply. You attach a workflow to one or more **projects** to run the same process consistently at scale.

<Frame caption="Workflow Builder canvas with steps, teams, and connections">
![Workflow Builder canvas](/images/workflows/workflow-canvas.png)
</Frame>

**Key characteristics**

- **Composable steps**: Each step belongs to a team, has a **type**, and exposes **statuses** (with one default).  
- **Semantic automation**: Status transitions can be triggered by **inputs**; completed statuses emit **outputs**. You wire outputs → inputs to automate orchestration across steps.  
- **Multi-agent execution**: Invoke Tessact’s first-party agents (e.g., remix, compliance, captioning, thumbnail generation) or **bring your own** third-party AI via connectors and webhooks.  
- **Safety by design**: Orchestration enforces **acyclic flows** (no infinite loops) and validates wiring before publish.

<Info>
Attach the same workflow to many projects. Each project tracks its own run state, artifacts, and audit history without duplicating design work.

## Core Concepts

### Steps, Types, and Statuses

- **Step** — A unit of work owned by a team (e.g., *Ingest*, *Edit*, *Compliance Review*, *Publish*).  
- **Type** — Optimised configuration for that step’s work mode. Examples include:
  - **Watch Folders** — Monitor Connected Folders and react to file events.
  - **AI Agent** — Run one or more agents (e.g., *Generate YouTube thumbnails*, *Blog post from webinar*, *Compliance scan*).
  - **Video Creation** — Editor-centric step for timeline edits and remixes.
  - **Manual Review** — Gate with assignments, SLAs, and decision outcomes.
  - **Publishing** — Prepare deliverables and push to destinations/CMS.
  - **Utility / Transform** — Transcode, proxy, sprite sheet, metadata extraction.
  - **Webhook / External Action** — Call external systems and wait for callbacks.

- **Statuses** — Each step has a **default** status (e.g., *Not started*), plus additional statuses (e.g., *In progress*, *Needs edit*, *Approved*, *Rejected*). Statuses power both visibility and automation.

![Step configuration](/images/workflows/step-config.png)
</Frame>

### Inputs & Outputs (Wiring)

- **Inputs** are *triggers* that cause a step’s status to change automatically (e.g., *AgentCompleted*, *FileMoved*, *ReviewApproved*, *TimeElapsed*, *WebhookReceived*, *MetadataUpdated*).  
- **Outputs** are *signals* emitted when a status is reached (e.g., *Edit.Completed → outputs.Done*).

**Wiring rules**

- Connect **Output → Input** to propagate progress across steps.  
- **Multiple Outputs → one Input** act as an **AND-gate**: the Input fires only when *all* connected Outputs are true.  
- **One Output → multiple Inputs** (fan-out) is allowed.  
- **No loops**: A step status cannot simultaneously use its own **IN** and **OUT** as triggers. The builder validates flows as a **DAG** (Directed Acyclic Graph).

<Warning>
Recurring loops are disallowed. The builder prevents connections that would create cycles or self-triggering feedback.
</Warning>

## First-Party and Third-Party AI Agents

Tessact ships with first-party agents (remix, captioning, translation, compliance, summarisation, blog/title/thumbnail generation, etc.). You can also add third-party AI (LLMs, vision, audio) via **connectors** or **webhooks** and treat them as workflow steps.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="First-party agent example">
Configure a **Thumbnail Generator** agent:

- **Inputs**: *Asset.Ready* (from Ingest), optional *MetadataUpdated:Brand*  
- **Parameters**: aspect ratios, brand palette, overlay template  
- **Outputs**: *Thumbnails.Created* (array of images), *Quality.OK/Fail*
</Tab>
<Tab title="Third-party agent example">
Call an external captioning service:

- **Webhook** step sends job spec (asset URL, language).  
- External system posts back to Tessact’s **Run Callback URL**.  
- On **Callback.Received** Input, move status to *Completed* and emit *Captions.Created*.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
Agents can run in parallel within a step or as separate steps; use **conditions** to branch on their outputs (e.g., *Compliance.Fail → Manual Review*).
</Note>

## Designing Workflows

### Typical End-to-End Pattern

1. **Ingest (Watch Folders / Library)** → asset appears and analyses automatically.  
2. **AI Agent Pack** → captioning, compliance, thumbnails, social remixes.  
3. **Manual Review** → approval gate with assignments and SLAs.  
4. **Publish** → deliver to CMS/social, archive to Connected Folder.

<Frame caption="Example: ingest → AI pack → review → publish">
![Example flow](/images/workflows/example-flow.png)
</Frame>

### Advanced Patterns

- **Editorial factory**: *AI Search for Clips* → *Remix* → *QC* → *Publish*.  
- **Knowledge expansion**: *Blog Generation from Video* → *SEO title & description* → *Manual copy edit* → *Publish*.  
- **Compliance with regional overrides**: *Compliance EU* AND *Compliance US* → both must pass before *Publish*.

## Create a Workflow (Step-by-Step)

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Workflow Builder">
  Go to **Workflows** in the sidebar → **New Workflow**.
</Step>

<Step title="Add steps">
  Drag **Step** onto the canvas. Choose **Type**, assign **Team**, and define **Statuses** (set a default).
</Step>

<Step title="Configure agents or actions">
  For **AI Agent** steps, select agents and parameters. For **Watch Folders**, choose a [Connected Folder](/connections/s3-setup) and event triggers.
</Step>

<Step title="Wire statuses">
  Connect **Output → Input** between steps. Use multiple Outputs to gate a single Input when all must be true.
</Step>

<Step title="Set manual review">
  Add a **Manual Review** step with assignment rules, due-by (SLA), and decision outcomes (*Approved*, *Needs edit*, *Rejected*).
</Step>

<Step title="Validate and publish">
  Click **Validate** to ensure the graph is acyclic and all required Inputs are satisfied. Then **Publish** the workflow.
  <Check>
  A green check indicates the workflow is ready to attach to projects.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Attach to a Project

- Create or open a **Project** → **Workflow** → select the published workflow.  
- Provide any **step-level parameters** required by chosen types (e.g., which Connected Folder to watch, or agent presets).  
- On save, the project enters the workflow’s **initial status** and begins execution when triggers fire.

<Info>
A single workflow can be attached to many projects. Parameters are stored per project, not globally.

## Manual Review Layers

- **Assignments** — Round-robin, owner-based, or group-based.  
- **Checklists** — Define criteria (e.g., brand safety, loudness).  
- **SLA timers** — Overdue states emit alerts and can auto-escalate.  
- **Decisions** — *Approved*, *Needs edit*, *Rejected* emit Outputs you can wire forward.

</Frame>

## Execution & Monitoring

- **Run History** — Timeline of step/status changes, agent jobs, and callbacks.  
- **Retries & Backoff** — Transient failures auto-retry with exponential backoff; hard failures surface with actionable logs.  
- **Idempotency** — External calls include a run-scoped idempotency key to avoid duplicate work.  
- **Alerts & Webhooks** — Subscribe to events (e.g., *Step.Failed*, *Publish.Completed*).


```json Webhook (event subscription)
{
  "event": "workflow.step.failed",
  "workflow_id": "wf_3bpv9",
  "project_id": "proj_9f2mx",
  "step": "Compliance Review",
  "status": "Failed",
  "attempt": 3,
  "run_id": "run_1a2b3c",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-25T10:45:12Z"
}
```


### Performance & Cost Management

- **Concurrency** — Limit concurrent agent executions per workflow or step.
- **GPU quotas** — Reserve or cap GPU-bound steps for predictable throughput.
- **Caching** — Reuse deterministic outputs (e.g., transcripts, embeddings) across runs.
- **Agent-compute minutes** — Usage accrues per agent runtime; see org-level analytics.

<Tip>
Place heavy transforms behind success-gated compliance checks to avoid wasted compute on assets that will be rejected.
</Tip>

Troubleshooting
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Validation fails: cyclic wiring">
Remove or reroute connections creating loops. The DAG validator highlights offending edges.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Step waits forever for Input">
Check upstream Outputs—if multiple are wired to the same Input, *all* must be true. Inspect the Run History for missing signals.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="External webhook never returns">
Verify the callback URL and idempotency key. Confirm firewall rules and TLS. Use the **Resend** action in Run History.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Agent exceeds quotas">
Increase concurrency limits or schedule during off-peak hours. Review compute minutes and cache eligibility.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
