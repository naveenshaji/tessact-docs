## What is Tessact?

Tessact is a **media-operations platform powered by a network of AI agents**.\
You bring any media—video, audio, images—and Tessact orchestrates specialised agents (generative and analytical) to perform tasks such as:

- **Editing & remixing** videos into multiple aspect ratios
- **Auto-generating YouTube thumbnails** with brand-safe graphics
- **Writing blog posts** or social captions based on spoken content
- **Detecting compliance issues** like nudity or profanity
- **Running manual review layers** when human sign-off is required

Agents work on top of an operational layer of **workflows** and **projects**, so you design processes once and reuse them across teams. Tessact also integrates third-party AI providers, making it the single hub where all your media operations happen.

<Info>
  Think of Tessact as your **media “control room”**—a place where first-party and third-party agents collaborate to ingest, transform, review, and publish content.

| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SaaS (default)** | Fully-managed, multi-tenant cloud; continuous updates.                                       | Fastest time to value.                                      |
| **Customer Cloud** | Tessact deployed entirely inside your AWS or GCP account; you control VPC, IAM, and billing. | Need full cloud sovereignty with minimal on-prem footprint. |
| **Hybrid Cloud**   | Media stays in your object store; compute runs in Tessact Cloud.                             | Reduce egress costs or comply with data-residency policies. |
| **On-Prem**        | Tessact nodes run in your data centre/private cloud.                                         | Broadcast or defence environments with strict compliance.   |

Licensing is subscription-based, metered by **seats \+ monthly content volume**. Custom enterprise plans include SLA guarantees, dedicated support, and volume pricing.

<Warning>
  On-prem and Customer-Cloud deployments require GPU nodes that meet Tessact’s hardware reference (NVIDIA A10 or higher).
